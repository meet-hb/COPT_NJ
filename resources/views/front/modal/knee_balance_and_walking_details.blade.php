                <h5>Difficulty Walking</h5>
                <p>
                    It takes us at least 12 months as a baby to learn the fundamentals of walking. It takes even longer
                    to learn how to walk properly and eventually run. Walking is very complex and requires good balance,
                    the ability to know where your joints are in space (proprioception), the ability to know how your
                    joints are moving (kinesthesia), good range of motion and strength. <br>

                    As we age, with declining activity or after an injury, walking can become difficult. With pain in
                    the knee or hip, our walking pattern can change, leaving us with a limp and possibly back pain.
                    Changes in posture can also be responsible for changes in walking patterns. <br>

                    When walking patterns change, abnormal stresses and strains with everyday activities can be
                    transmitted to areas it shouldn’t. For example, if you have knee pain and you begin to limp, the
                    other hip and your spine now have to take double the weight. This can lead to pain and dysfunction
                    in those areas also. The good news is that walking can be helped and our physical therapists are the
                    experts uniquely trained to do so.

                <p>
                    One of the main specialties of physical therapy is helping people to walk normally. This takes a
                    thorough evaluation of your range of motion, strength, walking patterns, balance and coordination.
                    By discovering in what area you have difficulties we can paint a picture of why your walking is not
                    as it should be. <br>

                    We then coordinate an extensive, but easy to do treatment plan that will address your range of
                    motion, pain, coordination, balance and strength. The end result is the ability to walk without the
                    need of an assistive device such as a cane or walker, safely and smoothly. Call us today to discover
                    how we can help you walk better!

                <h5>About Knee Post-surgery Rehab</h5>
                <p>Other types of surgeries for the knee are fracture repairs or ligament / tissue repair from trauma.
                    The amount of force it takes to break bone means that the soft tissues around the knee are most
                    likely significantly injured also. After surgery, due to limited movement, range of motion is lost
                    as well as strength. Since walking is a very complex action of different muscles moving in a
                    coordinated fashion, it can be difficulty to walk after a knee surgery.

                <h5>About Knee Pain</h5>
                <p>The knee is the most complex joint in the body. It has to bear the weight of the body while moving
                    through an incredible range of 130 degrees or more. When running the knee absorbs up to 6 times the
                    weight of your body in force! In a lifetime, it is estimated that the average person will take over
                    216 million steps and walk 108,000 miles. With this amount of use, at times things can go wrong and
                    lead to knee pain. <br>

                    Most knee pain stems from the loss of what is called “accessory motions”. Accessory motions are the
                    knee’s smaller movements that are sliding side-to-side, back and forth as well as spinning and
                    rotating. Without consistent stretching and especially without being very active, the tissues around
                    the knee become tight. In addition, if the muscles in the front or back of the knee become weaker,
                    that can lead to more abnormal forces on the knee joint. <br>

                    All of these problems lead to increased friction and wear on the knee. The normal response is one of
                    inflammation that can be felt as pain in and around the knee. A good rule of thumb is that if your
                    pain is achy, a lack of normal joint fluid flow is occurring as well as possible decreased
                    circulation around the knee to the muscles and tissues. However, with sharp pain during movement, an
                    area in the knee is being severely pressed upon and the movement of the joint is not normal.

                    Physical therapy is one of the most important treatments for knee pain. Whether it is from a sports
                    injury, tight musculature, altered joint mechanics or arthritis, we can help! <br>

                    The first step is to pinpoint the exact mechanism of why your knee pain is occurring. We perform a
                    thorough evaluation of your posture, knee motion, knee and hip strength, walking analysis and joint
                    mobility. From this we can discover the main reason for your knee pain and formulate a treatment
                    plan that will alleviate it quickly. <br>

                    Our physical therapists perform hands-on therapy to improve your knee joint mobility, reducing pain
                    quickly. Modalities such as ultrasound may be used to reduce swelling and pain. Specific exercises
                    will be performed to enhance your leg strength and address any unbalanced muscles that are
                    contributing to your knee pain. Call us today to find out how we can quickly and effectively
                    alleviate your knee pain!

                <h5>About Poor Balance / Risk of Falling</h5>
                <p>
                    Did you know that one out of three adults aged 65 and older fall each year? Among older adults,
                    falls are the leading cause of both fatal and nonfatal injuries. Our ability to balance when walking
                    or moving can change for a number of reasons. As we age, there is a natural loss of balance due to
                    slowing down of reflexes, muscle weakness and tissue changes. In addition, arthritis in the ankles,
                    knee or hips can affect balance. Furthermore, any neurological changes such as Parkinsons Disease,
                    spinal cord injuries, nerve injuries, back problems and much more can play a role in diminished
                    balance. <br>

                    Our ability to balance relies mainly on 3 factors. Our ability to perceive movement comes from the
                    nerve sensors in our joints and muscles, our vision and the position of our head in space through
                    the vestibular system in the inner ear. When any one of these factors is not optimum, our ability to
                    balance is affected and our risk for falling greatly increases. <br>

                    The good news is that there is a lot than can easily be done to improve your ability to balance,
                    which improves your walking and makes the risk of falling significantly less.

                    How physical therapy helps
                </h5>
                <p>
                    Physical therapy is the main treatment for poor balance and reducing the risk of falls. It begins
                    with a thorough evaluation of your walking, balance, coordination, joint movement, range of motion
                    and strength. In the case of neurological conditions, more testing is done to determine visual
                    tracking and your vestibular system function, which contributes to your balance. <br>

                    After discovering the root cause of your balance difficulties, we program a treatment plan that will
                    improve your ability to balance, walk and negotiate many different uneven terrains such as grass,
                    sand, stairs and more. In addition, if you use a cane or walker, we can instruct you in the proper
                    use of that adaptive equipment. Physical therapy goes a long way to improving your balance and
                    setting you on the safe path to enjoying activities you love. Call us today to learn more how we can
                    improve your balance and walking!

                <h5>About Total Knee Replacement</h5>
                <p>A total knee replacement surgery may be needed when the knee has suffered a significant trauma or due
                    to severe arthritis. In a total knee replacement surgery, the ends of the femur and tibia bones, and
                    backside of the kneecap are replaced. With a partial knee replacement either the end of the femur
                    bone or tibia is replaced. There have been many advances in the technology of the total knee
                    replacement prosthesis and procedures allowing for less invasive surgery and faster recovery times.
                    <br>

                    Typically people have suffered for a while before having surgery, leading to changes in walking,
                    muscle strength and function. Physical therapy before surgery in general has shown to help with the
                    speed and quality of recovery after surgery.

                    Typically, you start physical therapy in the hospital the day after your procedure. After
                    progressing from the hospital, it is very important to continue with outpatient physical therapy in
                    our practice. <br>

                    We complete the rehabilitation cycle, further restoring your range of motion via your physician’s
                    protocols, restoring normal walking, balance, knee coordination and alleviating pain. We ensure that
                    we continue to reinforce safety precautions with your knee movement while you heal. The end result

                <h5>About Lateral Collateral Ligament (LCL) Tears</h5>
                <p>The lateral Collateral ligament (LCL) is an important ligament that checks the side to side sliding
                    of the femur bone on the tibia bone in the knee. This ligament can be injured with sports or falls,
                    especially with blows to the inside of the knee while the foot is planted on the ground. <br>

                    The LCL can be sprained which means it is still intact. If it is ruptured it means it is completely
                    broken. When a LCL injury involves a sprain, there is typically swelling that occurs in the knee and
                    a feeling of instability with walking. Sprains are classified according to their severity with
                    grades 1 through 3. Grades 1 and 2 are often treatable without surgery, while grade 3 is most often
                    a complete tear and typically requires surgery. <br>

                    With a sprain, the ligament is overstretched and micro-tearing results, causing pain and
                    inflammation. There is little blood flow to the ligaments and they get most of their nutrition from
                    the joint fluid. This means, that their healing is a lot slower than most other tissues. Depending
                    on the severity of the sprain and joint stability the potential for future injury can increase. <br>

                    With grade 3 LCL tears, surgery is most likely needed to repair. Physical therapy is vital to the
                    rehabilitation after this surgery. Recovery does take time and the goal is to protect the surgery
                    site and maintaining stability while getting back into walking and eventually running.

                    Our physical therapists work with patients of all ages, especially those who have sustained LCL
                    tears through sports activities. We work closely with your physician to examine the stability of
                    your knee after the LCL injury. There are specific tests that we perform to assess how stable the
                    ligament is and what course of action is best to resolve your pain and return you to activities as
                    soon as possible. Most grade 1 and grade 2 sprains can be rehabilitated without the need for surgery
                    and our physical therapists will discuss your options. <br>

                    If surgery is needed for your recovery, rest assured that you are in the right hands for your
                    rehabilitation. We work closely with your physician’s rehabilitation protocols. The priority is to
                    manage your pain and swelling after surgery and gradually increasing your range of motion in the
                    knee per your post-surgery protocol. <br>

                <h5>About Posterior Cruciate Ligament (PCL) Tears</h5>
                <p>The posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) is an important ligament that checks the backward sliding of
                    the tibia bone on the femur bone in the knee. This ligament can be injured with sports or falls,
                    especially with blows to the front of the knee while the foot is planted on the ground. <br>

                    The PCL can be sprained which means it is still intact. If ruptured it means it is completely
                    broken. When a PCL injury involves a sprain, there is typically swelling that occurs in the knee and
                    a feeling of instability with walking. Sprains are classified according to their severity with
                    grades 1 through 3. Grades 1 and 2 are often treatable without surgery, while grade 3 is most often
                    a complete tear and typically requires surgery. <br>

                    With a sprain, the ligament is overstretched and micro-tearing results, causing pain and
                    inflammation. There is little blood flow to the ligaments and they get most of their nutrition from
                    the joint fluid. This means, that their healing is a lot slower than most other tissues. Depending
                    on the severity of the sprain and joint stability the potential for future injury can increase. <br>

                    With grade 3 PCL tears, surgery is most likely needed to repair. Physical therapy is vital to the
                    rehabilitation after this surgery. Recovery does take time and the goal is to protect the surgery
                    site, maintaining stability while getting back into walking and eventually running.

                <h5>About Knee Tendonitis</h5>
                <p>The ending of the word “itis” is defined as inflammation. Therefore, tendonitis is inflammation of a
                    tendon, which connects muscles to bones. Commonly, the tendon that connects your quadriceps muscle
                    to the tibia bone (quadriceps tendon above the kneecap and patellar ligament below the kneecap) can
                    become inflamed resulting in a condition also known as jumper’s knee. This thick tendon runs over
                    the top of your kneecap and attaches to the tibia bone below. This structure can often become
                    inflamed due to abnormal joint movements, poor posture and weakness of the surrounding musculature.
                    This causes strain to the tendon with resulting pain during repetitive movement and especially with
                    squatting or kneeling down. Other areas of tendonitis in the knee can occur such as the back,
                    outside or inside of the knee.

                <h5>
                    How physical therapy helps
                </h5>
                <p>
                    Physical therapy is the first line in conservative treatment for tendonitis. Most tendonitis is due
                    to underlying abnormal mechanics of movement, walking and weakness. Our trained physical therapists
                    are experts in evaluating your movement to pinpoint the source of the trouble. Modalities may be
                    used to alleviate pain and discomfort, while hands-on therapy improves joint mechanics and movement.
                    <br>

                    Finally, gentle strengthening exercises and joint coordination exercises help to restore stability
                    to the affected area and prevent re-occurrence of symptoms. To discover how we can help your knee
                    tendonitis call us today!

                <h5>About Meniscus Injury</h5>
                <p>The meniscus is a ring of cartilage on the lower part of the knee (the tibial plateau) that the end
                    of the large femur bone rides on. The meniscus is responsible for providing cushioning and stability
                    of the knee joint while guiding movement. It is connected on the outer edges to the thick ligaments
                    around the knee. The inside part of knee (medial meniscus) bears more weight and often sustains more
                    damage than the outside part (lateral meniscus). <br>

                    The meniscus is supposed to be smooth to ensure good gliding of the knee when it is bending. With
                    injuries, poor alignment or weak musculature, the meniscus can become bruised and even torn. The
                    outside edges of the meniscus have more blood flow than the inner portions. This means, depending on
                    the area were the damage is located the healing process can be slow. <br>

                    Many times, meniscus injuries are mild to moderate and can be rehabilitated with physical therapy.
                    However, at times surgical intervention may be necessary to clean and shave down the torn areas of
                    the meniscus. Physical therapy is very important in the full recovery after this surgical procedure.

                <p>
                    Physical therapy is a very important part of recovering from a meniscus injury. Most injuries are
                    mild and involve small tears, bruising or irritation. Physical therapy can pinpoint where there are
                    limitations in movement of the knee joint and weakened musculature support. By pinpointing the
                    mechanisms of injury, our treatments can focus on reducing your pain and swelling quickly. Then, we
                    focus on improving your range of motion, joint mobility and strengthening to make sure your meniscus
                    receives the necessary support. <br>

                    If surgery is necessary, we work closely with your physician and the rehabilitation protocol. The
                    primary focus is on eliminating swelling quickly, resolving pain, improving range of motion,
                    restoring normal walking and strengthening the supporting muscles around the knee. We then show you
                    what to do to maintain a healthy knee with physical activities and sports. Call us today to see how
                    we can help you recover quickly from a meniscus injury.

                <h5>Knee Sprain / Strain</h5>
                <p>Sprains refer to injuries of the ligaments (connect bone to bone) and strains refer to injuries of
                    the muscles or tendons (connect muscle to bone). Sprains and strains occur from quick
                    over-stretching of the tissues causing micro-tearing and subsequent injury. Swelling begins as part
                    of the inflammation process, causing pain and difficulty with movement. <br>

                    The first step in treating sprains or strains in the knee is to rest, ice and elevate it. With
                    severe limitations in movement you should see our physical therapists right away. There are
                    different levels of sprain or strain from mild to severe. In some cases, the tearing can be complete
                    and even be in need of surgical repair.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In most cases, physical therapy can effectively help you recover from a sprain or strain. We first
                    evaluate the injured area to determine the extent of the injury and ensure that the ligaments or
                    tendons are still intact. After we pinpoint the injured area, we formulate a treatment plan that
                    will quickly relieve your swelling, pain and begin restoring range of motion.

                    The goal of physical therapy is to restore your normal range of motion and eventually restore normal
                    strength. If you participate in sports or are very active, we work closely with you to make sure
                    that we help you fully recover and can participate in those activities you love to do. Call us today
                    to discover how we can effectively treat your sprains or strains.
