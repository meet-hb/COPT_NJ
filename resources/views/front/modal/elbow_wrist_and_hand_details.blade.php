                <p>
                    Sprains and strains are very common in the hand, wrist and elbow. Sprains refer to injuries of the
                    ligaments (connect bone to bone) and strains refer to injuries of the muscles or tendons (connect
                    muscle to bone). Sprains and strains occur from quick over-stretching of the tissues causing
                    micro-tearing and subsequent injury. Swelling begins as part of the inflammation process, causing
                    pain and difficulty with movement. <br>

                    The first step in treating sprains or strains in the wrist, elbow, hand or fingers is to rest, ice
                    and elevate it. With severe limitations in movement you should see your physical therapist right
                    away. There are different levels of sprain or strain from mild to severe. In some cases, the tearing
                    can be complete and even need surgical repair.</p>

                <h5>
                    How physical therapy helps
                </h5>
                <p>
                    In most cases, physical therapy can effectively help you recover from a sprain or strain. We first
                    evaluate the injured area to determine the extent of the injury and ensure that the ligaments or
                    tendons are still intact. After we pinpoint the injured area, we formulate a treatment plan that
                    will quickly relieve your swelling, pain and begin restoring range of motion. <br>

                    The goal of physical therapy is to restore your normal range of motion and eventually restore normal
                    strength. If you participate in sports or are very active, we work closely with you to make sure
                    that we help you fully recover and can participate in those activities you love to do. Call us today
                    to discover how we can effectively treat your sprains or strains.

                <h5>About Tendon Repair & Post-surgery Reha</h5>
                <p>Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS) is a very common condition and is becoming more frequent. The carpal
                    tunnel is a narrow tunnel in the wrist where major arteries and nerves pass from the forearm into
                    the wrist. One of the primary nerves that pass through this area is called the median nerve. When
                    the ligaments around the carpal tunnel become tight, pressure is applied to the median nerve causing
                    tingling, pain and even loss of sensation to the thumb and first two fingers of the hand. <br>

                    One of the primary causes of carpal tunnel syndrome is poor posture and repetitive activities such
                    as typing at a computer in the wrong position for many hours a day. The direct pressure on the wrist
                    from the desk along with the repetitive movement of the fingers can lead to a tightening of the
                    carpal tunnel ligaments. <br>

                    Those at risk of developing carpal tunnel often have neck or shoulder problems on that side that
                    lead to altered posture and movement of the arm. Since the median nerve exits from the neck and
                    passes through the shoulder all the way down to your fingers, carpal tunnel is affected by the
                    flexibility of the nerve higher up.

                    How physical therapy helps
                </h5>
                <p>
                    Physical therapy is one of the first lines of defense in treating carpal tunnel syndrome. It is
                    non-invasive and effective in eliminating symptoms and stopping them from returning. <br>

                    Our physical therapy treatments focus on improving the mobility of the wrist and spacing of the
                    carpal tunnel so the pressure is relieved on the median nerve. Hands on treatments mobilize tight
                    joints and stretch tight ligaments. Ultrasound and other modalities can reduce deep swelling
                    relieving pressure on the nerve. Finally, strengthening and range of motion exercises can support
                    the wrist and maintain good posture, helping the normal function of the median nerve. <br>

                    We also focus on long-term results by training you on specific exercises to perform at home and
                    work. Additionally, we train you on proper postural technique to prevent future reoccurrences. Call
                    us today to discover how we can effectively treat your carpal tunnel syndrome.

                <h5>About Nerve Injuries</h5>
                <p>There are many nerves traveling along the elbow, forearm, wrist and hand. With injuries to the hand,
                    wrist, forearm or elbow, nerve damage can result. Symptoms may be mild such as mild numbness,
                    tingling or abnormal temperature feelings. In severe cases, muscle function and paralysis can occur.
                    <br>

                    Many nerve injuries occur because of overuse and chronic swelling. This doesnâ€™t allow proper
                    circulation to flow to the nerves, affecting their functioning. Poor posture while doing common
                    activities generally causes overuse injuries and chronic swelling. If you have significant nerve
                    sensations into your arm, wrist or hand, it is important to follow up with us and your physician.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Physical therapy is very important to the healing aspect of nerve injuries. Whether mild from a
                    small injury or severe after surgery, our experts work with you and your physician to facilitate
                    your recovery. <br>

                    The emphasis of physical therapy is on removing pressure from around the nerve by restoring normal
                    tissue movement, joint movement and range of motion. Our hands-on therapy serves to soothe and
                    improve circulation, while stimulating nerves to restore normal function. Call us today to discover
                    how we help relieve your nerve pain and restore normal function.

                <h5>What is Tennis Elbow?</h5>
                <p>
                    Tennis elbow is a common term for lateral epicondylitis. You donâ€™t have to play tennis to develop
                    this condition, it actually happens frequently with repetitive tasks done in poor postural
                    positions, such as typing at too high of a desk. The muscles that extend your wrist and fingers
                    actually attach to the bony outside of your elbow. <br>

                    Typically with tennis elbow, severe tenderness will be present around the bony area on the outside
                    of the elbow. This can cause pain with gripping objects, lifting objects, twisting of the forearm
                    and more.
                </p>

                <h5>What is Golferâ€™s Elbow?</h5>
                <p>
                    Golferâ€™s elbow is a general term for medial epicondylitis. This is similar to tennis elbow (lateral
                    epicondylitis), except that it is on the inside bony area of the elbow. Reasons for this occurring
                    are similar to that of tennis elbow where there is an overuse of the muscles that flex your wrist
                    and fingers. These muscle tendons attach to the inside elbow bony area, and overuse results in
                    irritation.
                </p>

                    How physical therapy helps
                </h5>
                <p>
                    Tennis elbow and golferâ€™s elbow can be treated very effectively with physical therapy. Modalities
                    such as ultrasound, heat and ice can assist with reducing swelling quickly in the irritated tendons.
                    Furthermore, hands on therapy for the tissues and joints helps to restore normal joint movement,
                    break up any scar adhesions in the tissue and bring circulation to the area to promote healing. <br>

                    As the pain subsides, the focus is shifted to making sure your proper range of motion in the elbow
                    and wrist are returned to normal. Gentle strengthening programs are started to help support the
                    affected area and regain your strength. In addition, we educate you on proper posture and techniques
                    to manage work and repetitive activities so the condition does not continue. Call us today to
                    discover how we can help quickly relieve your tennis elbow or golferâ€™s elbow pain.

                <h5>Elbow Pain, Wrist Pain, Hand Pain</h5>
                <p>
                    Elbow pain can come from a variety of sources, but typically occurs due to an overuse of the elbow
                    joint from repetitive activities. Often bad posture with typing, writing, lifting or sports, makes
                    the tissues around the elbow become irritated. <br>

                    The elbow actually has quite a few different joints that move in very unique ways. The same bones
                    (radius and ulna) that make up the elbow also form the wrist and play a key role in the movements of
                    the hands. Most of the muscles that make your wrist and fingers move are actually located in the
                    forearm. <br>

                    Poor posture, repetitive activities such as typing, gripping and twisting can cause tightening in
                    the muscles and tissues of the forearm. This can affect the mobility of the elbow, wrist and even
                    hands. This can lead to chronic inflammation and irritation to these areas.

                <p>
                    Physical therapy helps to relieve elbow pain, wrist pain and hand pain by examining the mechanics of
                    your joints and muscles. By identifying where you are having limitations, analyzing your daily
                    activities and strength of certain muscle groups, the root cause of your pain can be discovered.
                    <br>
                    A comprehensive plan is then built to improve your range of motion, reduce your pain quickly, soothe
                    stiff and sore muscles and return your strength. In addition, we work with you to educate you on
                    techniques and exercises to prevent future injury or possibly adapt your work environment. Call us
                    today to discover how we can help relieve your elbow pain, wrist pain or hand pain.

                <p>
                    Fractures in the wrist and forearm area are common with falls, as the tendency is to protect oneself
                    during the fall. Common fractures occur in the bones of the forearm near the wrist called the radius
                    and ulna. Two common fractures are called Collesâ€™ fracture and Smithâ€™s fracture. Collesâ€™ fractures
                    typically occur from falls onto an outstretched hand and Smithâ€™s fractures occur from falling
                    backward onto an outstretched hand. <br>

                    Another common fracture of the wrist and hand is the Scaphoid fracture, which is a small bone in the
                    hand. The scaphoid bone connects with the radius bone of the forearm. Scaphoid fractures are more
                    difficult to heal due to poor circulation to the bone itself. <br>

                    Fractures are managed medically and depending on the type of fracture and severity you may be placed
                    into a cast or surgically repaired with pins, plates or screws.

                    How physical therapy helps

                <p>
                    During the healing phase typically in a cast or after surgery, the fingers, wrist and elbow become
                    very stiff, range of motion and strength are lost. Physical therapy is very important in the
                    rehabilitative process to help you regain normal range of motion, reduce swelling, resolve pain and
                    regain function of your hand and wrist. <br>

                    Physical therapy is gentle and will help you quickly resolve your pain while working with your
                    doctor to follow protocol and restore your function. With physical therapy, you can make a complete
                    recovery quickly and safely. Call us today to learn more how we can help you fully recover after a
                    fracture.
