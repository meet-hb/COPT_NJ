                <h5>What is Herniated or Bulging Disc?</h5>
                <p>A disc is a jelly like, fluid filled sac that acts as a cushion between the bones of your neck
                    (vertebrae). Your discs change as you age, drying out and becoming more brittle. In addition, as
                    the discs dry out with age, the change in height between the vertebrae decreases, causing
                    changes in posture and function. In younger adults, the center of the disc (nucleus) is held in
                    place by many rings of the disc (picture a cross section of a tree trunk). With minor or major
                    injuries, poor posture and strain, these rings can rupture allowing a pressing outward of the
                    disc nucleus. Finally, as the nucleus reaches the outer edges, the disc can begin to bulge,
                    which in turn can rub and irritate nerve roots exiting your spine.</p>
                <p>In more severe cases, the disc can become herniated, which further presses into the spaces where
                    nerves are exiting. Symptoms can range from localized pain, to numbness / tingling to a specific
                    part of the shoulder, arm or hands. In more severe cases complete lack of sensation, muscle
                    weakness and paralysis of an area of the upper extremity can occur.</p>
                <p>Changes in posture, strength and range of motion can all affect the positioning of the disc and
                    how much bulging or herniation is occurring.</p>
                <h5>
                    How physical therapy helps
                </h5>
                <p>
                    The good news is that the majority of bulging and herniated discs can be treated conservatively
                    with physical therapy. By working with your medical history, symptoms and testing, our physical
                    therapists can determine what areas have been affected.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A thorough plan is then created to relieve pressure on the disc by improving joint function,
                    muscle strength and posture. Modalities, such as ultrasound or electrical stimulation may be
                    used to reduce pain, muscle spasm or inflammation. Our therapists work with you to recover lost
                    strength and range of motion. In addition, we then train you on the correct exercises to
                    maintain good posture and reduce the risk of future episodes. Call us today to discover how we
                    can help relieve your pain quickly and restore your function!

                <h5>About Vertigo</h5>
                <p>Vertigo and dizziness can be the result of a variety of different factors. Vertigo or benign
                    paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) can occur because of calcium crystals that form in the inner
                    ear labyrinth canals. These canals give feedback about balance to your brain.
                </p>
                <h5>About Dizziness</h5>
                <p>Dizziness can occur for a variety of reasons, including issues with medication. Issues with mobility
                    of the neck joints and muscles can also affect dizziness. When this occurs, the major arteries in
                    the neck which supply the back portion of the brain that control balance and orientation can be
                    affected.</p>
                <p>It is important to note that just because your pain is felt in one location, that is not usually the
                    source of the trouble. For example pain on the outside of the shoulder can be from an impingement of
                    the joint or problems with the rotator cuff muscles. However, this can be caused by poor positioning
                    and functioning of the shoulder blade, which is the real culprit. Treat the source of the problem
                    and the irritation will resolve.</p>

                </h5>
                <p>
                    Our physical therapists perform a thorough examination of your balance and vestibular symptoms. We
                    evaluate your visual movements, positioning of your head, neck mobility and balance. At times, we
                    may need to provoke symptoms to determine the exact mechanism of your vertigo or dizziness. <br>

                    If you are suffering with dizziness and vertigo, you can benefit from physical therapy intervention
                    to improve symptoms and increase your neck mobility. There are specific vestibular and balance
                    exercises that are performed to settle the calcium deposits in the inner ear and improve your
                    balance systems. Call us today to discover how we can stop your vertigo or dizziness and make you
                    feel like yourself again.

                <h5>About Temporomandibular Joint Dysfunction (TMD)</h5>
                <p>Temporomandibular Joint Dysfunction (TMD) describes the problems that may occur at the
                    temporomandibular joint (TMJ). This joint is where your jaw bone attaches to the skull. It is a
                    complex joint that has to slide forward and drop down in order for your jaw to open. It moves
                    thousands of times a day with talking, eating and any time you move your jaw. The joint has a disc
                    or fluid filled sac within it and has many ligaments and muscles that coordinate movements. <br>

                    The TMJ relies heavily on proper posture and alignment to function well. The posture and positioning
                    of the neck and head play a large role in the pulls of muscles on the TMJ. Abnormal muscle pulls can
                    lead to altered movement of the TMJ and thus pain.</p>

                    Physical therapy helps TMJ suffers in a number of ways. Our therapists work with you to determine
                    the exact mechanisms of your TMJ and where you have poor alignment of the TMJ, neck and head. By
                    improving posture, movement and function, the normal muscle balance and movement of the TMJ can be
                    restored. Call us today to discover how we can help relieve your pain quickly.

                <h5>What is Degenerative Disc Disease?</h5>
                <p>
                    As a normal part of the aging process, the fluid filled discs between our neck bones (vertebrae) dry
                    out and shrink. However, in some individuals, this can be excessive, leading to a severe loss of
                    height in one or more sections of the neck. This loss of height can increase rubbing of bone on
                    bone, produce bone spurring, increase pressure on joints and nerves exiting the neck. <br>

                    Symptoms can range from chronic aching pain in the neck, to radiating pain in the arms, numbness /
                    tingling and headaches.

                    Physical therapy is a very important part in the maintenance of degenerative disc disease (DDD) and
                    degenerative joint disease (DJD). While the disease process itself can’t be changed, maintaining
                    good posture, joint mobility, alignment, strength and range of motion, can reduce or eliminate
                    symptoms and maintain a healthier spine. <br>

                <h5>What is Arthritis and Stenosis?</h5>
                <p>
                    As we age, we use our neck joints and muscles thousands of times a day. This wear and tear over time
                    can lead to bony changes in the joints and bones (vertebrae) of the neck. These bony changes, along
                    with poor posture, cause spurs of bone that can rub and irritate the surrounding tissue. <br>

                    When the spurs protrude in the holes on the side of the neck where the nerves exit out (foramen), or
                    the central spinal cord canal, this is called spinal stenosis. Spinal stenosis can be central
                    stenosis or foramenal stenosis. It can cause a variety of symptoms, from chronic pain, to numbness
                    and tingling into the arms. In severe cases of central canal stenosis, which affects the spinal
                    cord, poor balance, pain in the legs and difficulty with walking can occur.
                </p>
                <p>People with osteoarthritis in the neck can experience chronic pain, stiffness and limited range of
                    motion with turning their head and looking up. Pain may be worse in the morning or after prolonged
                    sitting. <br>

                    People with rheumatoid arthritis can suffer with neck pain. It is very important for people with
                    rheumatoid arthritis to maintain strength in their shoulder, neck and postural muscles. This is
                    because a very important ligament in the upper neck often weakens with rheumatoid arthritis and can
                    be a serious health risk if injured.</p>

                    Forward head syndrome is extremely common in today’s society and describes a condition where, due to
                    changes in posture, the head juts forward actually shortening the neck. This can be mild or severe

                    posture watching TV and a host of other common poor postures, changes in your spine can occur over

                    10–12lbs of your head are pulling forward on your spine. <br> Over time, the normal curve in your
                    neck reduces, the length of the spine decreases and muscles in the neck become weaker. This can lead
                    to a variety of symptoms from neck pain, to headaches and even impinged nerves radiating pain into

                <p>
                    If you are experiencing radiating pain to the shoulder, arm and even hands, the source of your
                    trouble could be your neck or “cervical spine”. The nerves that supply sensation and movement travel
                    from your neck down your arms. These nerves exit from your spine on both sides supplying the left
                    and right sides respectively. Often with poor posture, poor alignment, muscle weakness or injury,
                    the structure of the spine can change. This can lead to a narrowing of the holes where the different
                    nerves exit from your spinal cord, out of the neck to the shoulders and upper extremities. These
                    holes (foramen) depend on the proper alignment and movement of each level of joints in your neck.
                </p>

                <p>Symptoms often start off as a mild, occasional tingling to certain areas of the shoulder, arm or
                    hand. It can then worsen to pain and even numbness. This does require medical attention, so call us
                    for an evaluation immediately and we will coordinate with your physician. Most symptoms can be
                    reduced quickly. However, the time it takes to reduce symptoms depends on how long and to the extent
                    the symptoms have been occurring.</p>

                    headaches. While there are many different “triggers” such as alcohol, chocolate, scents and other
                    factors for headaches and migraines, most suffers do have some underlying neck problem that causes
                    their headaches. These are called “cervico-genic headaches”. <br>

                    Headaches and migraines are often spasms of the arteries in the scalp or base of the neck triggering
                    a whirlwind of abnormal electrical activity in the brain. This can cause a variety of symptoms
                    depending on where this is occurring in the head. Most headaches have a component of stress. When
                    stressed, our neck muscles tense on a chronic basis, and with supporting our head all day long,
                    become very irritated. Along with other triggers, this can start a headache or migraine. It is why
                    many headache and migraine sufferers have symptoms later on in the day.</p>

                    How physical therapy helps
                </h5>
                <p>

                    Our trained physical therapists examine for many different factors that can be adding to the causes
                    of your headache or migraine. They look for correct alignment, posture, muscle strength of the neck,
                    upper back and shoulders, joint movement in the neck and much more. <br>

                    If there are limitations in movement or strength in the neck or upper back, this will be addressed
                    to restore your normal mobility. This also increases blood flow in the area, reducing the common
                    spasms that can occur. In addition, our therapists will train you on exercises and techniques that
                    you can use to prevent future occurrences.

                <h5>What is Whiplash?</h5>
                <p>


                    Whiplash can occur with many different accidents, but is often seen in motor vehicle accidents. The
                    weight of the head and spine is whipped back and forth with the fast movement of an accident or
                    fall. The muscles in the neck don’t have time to react and the harsh forces, strain, rip and tear
                    muscles, ligaments and other tissues. In severe cases, fractures can occur in the bones of the neck
                    (vertebrae). <br>

                    Due to the shock and trauma initially from an accident, pain may or may not be present. Whiplash
                    typically feels worse 1–2 days after the injury as inflammation sets in and tissues become swollen.
                    This can lead to headaches, pain with movement and even numbness / tingling into the upper
                    extremities. <br>

                    Often, people can have long standing weakness of the neck muscles, leading to future problems, if
                    their whiplash is not fully treated. Strengthening and postural exercises are very important to
                    maintain stability in the neck after a whiplash injury.</p>

                    How physical therapy helps
                </h5>
                <p>
                    There are different phases or treatment to help you after suffering whiplash. Our therapists will
                    work with your physician on the appropriate treatment to help you recover and relieve your pain. At
                    first very gentle hands on therapy, massage, ultrasound and electrical stimulation may be
                    administered to relieve the pain and gently help swollen tissues recover. <br>

                    Gradual progression is then made with restoring range of motion and beginning very gentle exercises.
                    As you progress, the pain reduces and your range of motion improves, strengthening and postural
                    exercises will be introduced to help you have a full recovery. It is very important to continue
                    through with the recommended treatment plan of your therapist to achieve a full recovery and prevent
                    future problems from occurring. Call us today to discover how we can help you relieve your whiplash

                <h5>Neck Pain</h5>
                <p>
                    There are many different reasons for neck pain. The neck requires good alignment, proper movement,
                    strength and stability to work correctly. The neck or cervical spine has to bear the weight of the
                    head, which is around 10-12lbs (the weight of a bowling ball). With injury or prolonged poor posture
                    (for example sitting at a computer), change in alignment, weakness and instability start to occur.
                    This irritates the structures of the neck and can even impinge on the nerves exiting the neck, or
                    the central canal protecting the spinal cord.</p>

                <h5>
                    How physical therapy helps
                </h5>
                <p>
                    Our physical therapists perform a thorough evaluation of your neck to determine your range of
                    motion, strength, posture and alignment. Sometimes, where the pain is occurring, is not the source
                    of the problem. Often a limitation in movement above or below the painful area is causing excessive
                    pressure or poor function of the painful area. With gentle hands on therapy, special exercises and
                    modalities such as ultrasound or electrical stimulation, we can relieve your pain, restore motion
                    and get you back to activities quickly without neck pain.

                <h5>About Shoulder Post-surgery Rehab</h5>
                <p>

                    There are a variety of shoulder surgeries that may have to be done in order to stabilize the
                    shoulder, repair damaged tendons or ligaments. With the advances in arthroscopic surgery, recovery
                    times for shoulder injuries have improved, however physical therapy is still needed to reduce pain
                    quickly, restore range of motion, improve strength and return the individual to the normal
                    activities they like to do.</p>

                <h5>
                    How physical therapy helps
                </h5>
                <p>

                    Post-surgery recovery can be difficult on sleeping, bathing, dressing and many other normal daily
                    activities we take for granted. Our physical therapists work with you to teach you how to adapt to
                    these activities of daily living while recovering.
                    Physical therapy focuses on providing you with inflammation and pain control to reduce your pain as
                    quickly as possible while you are recovering. The surgical process can often leave muscles cramped
                    and irritated. Our gentle hands-on therapy is perfect for soothing sore muscles and restoring normal
                    muscle movement.
