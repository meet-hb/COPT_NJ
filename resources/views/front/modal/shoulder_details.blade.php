                <h5>What is Herniated or Bulging Disc?</h5>
                <p>A disc is a jelly like, fluid filled sac that acts as a cushion between the bones of your neck
                    (vertebrae). Your discs change as you age, drying out and becoming more brittle. In addition, as
                    the discs dry out with age, the change in height between the vertebrae decreases, causing
                    changes in posture and function. In younger adults, the center of the disc (nucleus) is held in
                    place by many rings of the disc (picture a cross section of a tree trunk). With minor or major
                    injuries, poor posture and strain, these rings can rupture allowing a pressing outward of the
                    disc nucleus. Finally, as the nucleus reaches the outer edges, the disc can begin to bulge,
                    which in turn can rub and irritate nerve roots exiting your spine.</p>
                <p>In more severe cases, the disc can become herniated, which further presses into the spaces where
                    nerves are exiting. Symptoms can range from localized pain, to numbness / tingling to a specific
                    part of the shoulder, arm or hands. In more severe cases complete lack of sensation, muscle
                    weakness and paralysis of an area of the upper extremity can occur.</p>
                <p>Changes in posture, strength and range of motion can all affect the positioning of the disc and
                    how much bulging or herniation is occurring.</p>

                    How physical therapy helps
                </h5>
                <p>
                    The good news is that the majority of bulging and herniated discs can be treated conservatively
                    with physical therapy. By working with your medical history, symptoms and testing, our physical
                    therapists can determine what areas have been affected.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A thorough plan is then created to relieve pressure on the disc by improving joint function,
                    muscle strength and posture. Modalities, such as ultrasound or electrical stimulation may be
                    used to reduce pain, muscle spasm or inflammation. Our therapists work with you to recover lost
                    strength and range of motion. In addition, we then train you on the correct exercises to
                    maintain good posture and reduce the risk of future episodes. Call us today to discover how we
                    can help relieve your pain quickly and restore your function!

                <h5>Shoulder Pain</h5>
                <p>The shoulder is the most complex joint in the human body. It has to move through more than 180
                    degrees of motion in many directions, rotate, slide and spin. There are a variety of muscles that
                    have to work in concert to ensure the shoulder joint tracks properly with everyday activities. It is
                    made up of the humerus bone, scapula (shoulder blade) and clavicle (collar bone). There are
                    technically 4 joints that make up the entire shoulder complex.</p>
                <p>Poor posture, weakened muscles, injury and lack of proper range of motion can all factor into
                    shoulder pain. Shoulder pain is typically felt in the muscles between the shoulder and neck, as well
                    as the outside shoulder radiating down. Where your pain is can determine what structures are
                    involved.</p>
                <p>It is important to note that just because your pain is felt in one location, that is not usually the
                    source of the trouble. For example pain on the outside of the shoulder can be from an impingement of
                    the joint or problems with the rotator cuff muscles. However, this can be caused by poor positioning
                    and functioning of the shoulder blade, which is the real culprit. Treat the source of the problem
                    and the irritation will resolve.</p>

                    It is important that when you have shoulder pain, you have our experts evaluate your motion,
                    strength, coordination and joint mobility. By determining the root cause of your pain, we can then
                    treat it effectively for fast pain relief, improved motion, strength and return to normal
                    activities. The goal is to restore your normal shoulder movement without pain. Call us today to
                    discover how we can quickly resolve your shoulder pain and get you back to the activities you love.

                <h5>Shoulder Pain</h5>
                <p>Dislocation of the shoulder typically occurs from falling onto an outstretched arm or a blow to the
                    side or back of the shoulder when falling on it. This can happen in different sports activities or
                    falls. Dislocations are managed medically to relocate the head of the humerus bone. Depending on the
                    severity of the dislocation, your physician will typically prescribe physical therapy to help
                    stabilize the shoulder joint and protect it during a recovery phase.</p>
                <p>With frequent dislocations, the shoulder can become unstable as many structures in the shoulder get
                    damaged and become too lax. By strengthening the muscles around the shoulder, stability can be
                    increased in the shoulder, preventing future dislocations.

                    At times, dislocations can be quite severe and lead to tearing of cartilage, tendons, ligaments or
                    muscles. In this case, surgery is often needed. After surgery physical therapy is an important part
                    of recovery and returning to normal activities.</p>

                <h5>
                    How physical therapy helps
                </h5>
                <p>
                    Physical therapy is very important after a dislocation. Our physical therapists work with you
                    closely to protect the joint while it heals, teach you how to take care of your injury and gently
                    rehabilitate your shoulder. During the healing phase, your shoulder will be protected and pain will
                    be addressed.

                    Per your physician’s protocol we will gradually increase your range of motion, maintaining your
                    joint stability. Further into therapy, gentle strengthening is performed to improve the muscle
                    support around the shoulder. Ideally, full range of motion and strength is recovered allowing you to
                    return to normal activities and with the knowledge to protect your shoulder from further injury.
                    Call us today to find out how we can help you quickly recover from a shoulder dislocation.

                <h5>About Labrum Tear</h5>
                <p>
                    The labrum is a thick ring of cartilage around the socket part of your shoulder joint (glenohumeral
                    joint). The labrum acts like a cup for the head of the humerus to sit in (like a ball inside a cup).
                    The labrum gives stability to the joint and also helps to cushion as the shoulder joint moves.
                </p>
                <p>The labrum can tear with injury from a blow to an outstretched arm or from repetitive injuries
                    overhead. Sometimes, a labrum tear can be involved when the rotator cuff is torn. A common tear is
                    called a SLAP lesion (Superior Labral tear from Anterior to Posterior). This is a tear of the labrum
                    from the top part in front to back. This often needs surgical repair and we work with your physician
                    on their protocol to rehab your shoulder after surgery.</p>

                    How physical therapy helps
                </h5>
                <p>
                    Most often, labral tears are fixed surgically and need physical therapy after the procedure. We work
                    very closely with your physician to follow their protocols for rehabilitation to your shoulder.
                    Physical therapy involves a progress of your range of motion per the protocol and towards the end
                    restoring motion. In the meantime, pain, swelling and function are addressed. Call us today to find
                    out we can help you recover after a labral tear.

                <h5>What is Frozen Shoulder?</h5>
                <p>
                    Frozen shoulder is a painful shoulder joint condition. In medical terminology it is called “adhesive
                    capsulitis”. How frozen shoulder exactly begins is still a bit of a mystery, however, it typically
                    occurs after a trauma or repetitive injury to the shoulder. Women in the pre and post–menopausal age
                    range are more likely to experience frozen shoulder, however men can also experience frozen
                    shoulder.
                </p>
                <p>With frozen shoulder, the thick capsule of tissue that surrounds the shoulder joint begins to
                    experience chronic inflammation. The body begins a cycle of inflammation and scarring that causes
                    the capsule around the shoulder joint to contract and become limited in its flexibility. This causes
                    very painful range of motion in the shoulder when trying to move the arm.</p>
                <p>At the beginning of frozen shoulder it is very painful and range of motion becomes limited. This can
                    be around 4–8 weeks in duration. After that, motion is very limited in the shoulder, but often not
                    as painful. Depending on the severity of the condition, it can take sometimes up to a year to
                    resolve and improve range of motion.</p>

                <h5>
                    How physical therapy helps
                </h5>
                <p>
                    Physical therapy can make a big difference in shortening the time it takes to recover from frozen
                    shoulder (adhesive capsulitis). By coming to therapy as early as possible, the inflammatory cycle
                    can be significantly reduced, limiting scarring and contraction of the shoulder capsule. In turn,
                    physical therapy, along with medication can limit the pain and ensure a faster recovery.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our physical therapists work with many frozen shoulder patients to reduce pain quickly and restore
                    range of motion to the shoulder. Physical therapy treatments focus on hands–on therapy and
                    specialized exercises to maintain as much range of motion as possible during the inflammatory phase
                    of frozen shoulder. During the “thawing” phase we work with you to improve range of motion in your
                    shoulder and restore strength.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It can take quite awhile for the motion to be restored to the shoulder, but by coming to physical
                    therapy, we can help you recover as quickly as possible. Call us today to find out how we can help
                    you relieve your frozen shoulder pain!

                <h5>Rotator Cuff Injuries</h5>
                <p>
                    The rotator cuff is a group of muscles surrounding the shoulder. They are made up of the
                    supraspinatus, infraspinatus, sub–scapularis and teres minor muscles. While these muscles are small
                    and not that powerful, they play a critical role in how the shoulder moves. Without your rotator
                    cuff, you would not be able to lift your arm very far from your side. The job of the rotator cuff is
                    to guide the direction of the humerus head down and spin so that it clears the bony shelf above the
                    socket called the acromion. When the rotator cuff is weak, the head of the humerus rides up slamming
                    into the acromion above it.</p>

                <p>The rotator cuff takes a lot of abuse over a lifetime and tearing is very common as we age. Many
                    factors can lead to injury to the rotator cuff such as sports injuries, falls onto the shoulder or
                    arm, repeat lifting or movements, poor posture or heavy lifting in abnormal positions.</p>

                <p>Rotator cuff tears can be minor, causing pain and inflammation, or major which can require surgery.
                    With surgery, depending on a variety factors such as the quality of the tissue, the extent of the
                    tear and other health factors, the recovery can take between 3-6 months. Physical therapy is a very
                    important part of preparing for surgery and rehabilitating after surgery.

                <p>
                    Often, with small tears, physical therapy can dramatically reduce pain, improve function and allow
                    you to lead an active lifestyle without any problems. Our physical therapists will work with you to
                    improve your shoulder range of motion, restore proper joint mobility, reduce inflammation, relieve
                    pain and improve the strength of your rotator cuff.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If surgery is needed, we work closely with your physician to follow his/her protocol on
                    rehabilitation. The beginning of therapy focuses on reducing pain, education on protection of the
                    surgery repair, and maintaining a certain range of motion. Over time, as your physician protocol
                    allows, range of motion is increased, joint mobility is restored and finally very gentle
                    strengthening is begun.

                <p>
                    Towards the end of your physical therapy further strengthening and complete range of motion will be
                    attained for your shoulder. All of this is coordinated per the instructions of your physician and we
                    ensure thorough communication with your physician at all times. Call us today to learn more about

                    you to lead an active lifestyle without any problems. Our physical therapists will work with you to
                    improve your shoulder range of motion, restore proper joint mobility, reduce inflammation, relieve
                    pain and improve the strength of your rotator cuff.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If surgery is needed, we work closely with your physician to follow his/her protocol on
                    rehabilitation. The beginning of therapy focuses on reducing pain, education on protection of the
                    surgery repair, and maintaining a certain range of motion. Over time, as your physician protocol
                    allows, range of motion is increased, joint mobility is restored and finally very gentle
                    strengthening is begun.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Towards the end of your physical therapy further strengthening and complete range of motion will be
                    attained for your shoulder. All of this is coordinated per the instructions of your physician and we
                    ensure thorough communication with your physician at all times. Call us today to learn more about
                    how we help your rotator cuff perform better and relieve your shoulder pain.

                <h5>About Sports Injuries</h5>
                <p>


                    Whether you are a professional athlete, high school athlete or just like to be active and play
                    sports, injuries can occur. Many shoulder sports injuries occur because of a fall onto an
                    outstretched arm or from repetitive overhead actions, such as swimming or tennis. Another reason for
                    shoulder sports injuries is an imbalance which can occur in certain groups of the shoulder muscles
                    if one group of muscles is stronger than another. For example, an athlete that has strong chest
                    muscles, but weak rotator cuff muscles can put themselves at risk of injury.</p>

                <h5>What is Bursitis / Tendonitis?</h5>
                <p>


                    The ending of the word “itis” is defined as inflammation. Therefore, bursitis is inflammation of a
                    bursa and tendonitis is inflammation of a tendon. A bursa is a fluid filled sac that sits between
                    muscles or tissues to cushion and reduce friction. In the shoulder there is a rather large bursa
                    between the deltoid muscle and joint. This is called the sub-deltoid bursa. This bursa can often
                    become inflamed due to abnormal joint movements, poor posture and weakness of the surrounding
                    musculature. This causes strain to the tissues and excessive friction on the bursa. People tend to
                    feel pain with movement and especially movement out to the side or reaching behind them.</p>

                <p>Tendons connect muscles to bones. In the shoulder common areas for tendonitis are in the rotator cuff
                    tendons (supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor and subscapularis) and bicep tendons. Pain can be
                    felt deep in the shoulder or in the front of the shoulder. Pain is usually felt as a sharp, catching
                    sensation with certain movements.

                <p>

                    There are a variety of shoulder surgeries that may have to be done in order to stabilize the
                    shoulder, repair damaged tendons or ligaments. With the advances in arthroscopic surgery, recovery
                    times for shoulder injuries have improved, however physical therapy is still needed to reduce pain
                    quickly, restore range of motion, improve strength and return the individual to the normal
                    activities they like to do.</p>

                <p>

                    Post-surgery recovery can be difficult on sleeping, bathing, dressing and many other normal daily
                    activities we take for granted. Our physical therapists work with you to teach you how to adapt to
                    these activities of daily living while recovering.
                    Physical therapy focuses on providing you with inflammation and pain control to reduce your pain as
                    quickly as possible while you are recovering. The surgical process can often leave muscles cramped
                    and irritated. Our gentle hands-on therapy is perfect for soothing sore muscles and restoring normal
                    muscle movement.

                <h5>About Shoulder Fractures</h5>
                <p>
                    Fractures in the shoulder occur for a variety of reasons, but typically from a fall onto the
                    shoulder itself. Fractures can occur in seniors also due to osteoporosis (thinning and weakening of
                    bone).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The goal with fracture management is to provide a safe position for the bone to heal (typically
                    around 8 weeks), while maintaining range of motion. As the bone heals, strengthening can begin and
                    rehabilitation back to normal activities is progressed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At times surgery may be needed to hold the bone together with plates or screws. This stabilizes the
                    bone, but does disrupt muscles and leads to more weakness in the shoulder muscles. Physical therapy
                    is very much needed after this to restore normal range of motion and strength to the shoulder.
                    Recovery times can vary, but traditionally take 12–16 weeks.
                </p>
