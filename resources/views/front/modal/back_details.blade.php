                <h5>About Post-surgery Rehab</h5>
                <p>
                    There are many surgical procedures for the low back including discectomies, laminectomies and even
                    spinal fusion surgeries. The goal of most of these surgeries is to remove any broken bone, tissues
                    or discs that may be pressing on exiting nerves from the spine. Furthermore, bringing stability to
                    the spinal area is critical. It is important that you discuss with your physician conservative
                    treatments first, such as physical therapy before surgery is absolutely necessary.</p>

                <h5>
                    How physical therapy helps
                </h5>
                <p>

                    Physical therapy plays a critical role in the recovery after low back surgeries. We work closely
                    with your physician to ensure that we follow the surgical protocols in your recovery. Typically, the
                    first phase is to help with pain-relief and education in proper movement to protect your surgery
                    site while healing occurs. As your physician clears you for more activities, gentle hands on therapy
                    and very gentle exercises of the legs, hips, abdominals and supporting muscles begin. Generally
                    range of motion is begun and activation of stabilizing muscles. <br>

                    As you heal and your surgery protocol allows, gentle strengthening exercises are begun along with
                    specific stabilization exercises to rehabilitate your core muscles that support your spine. Physical
                    therapy for walking, balance and spinal coordination are also performed. The goal is to reduce your
                    back pain quickly, protect your spine during recovery and properly rehabilitate your spine to allow
                    you to return to normal activities. Call us today before or after spinal surgery, we can help!

                <h5>About Compression Fractures</h5>
                <p>Compression fractures in the low back typically occur in older individuals and those suffering from
                    osteoporosis. However, with severe trauma, such as in an accident, the force can cause a compression
                    fracture in the bones of the spine (vertebrae). There are many minimally invasive surgical
                    procedures today that can stabilize the broken area, such as kyphoplasty. <br>

                    The goal with managing compression fractures is to stabilize pieces of bone from moving around and
                    allow time for the bone to heal. Dealing with a compression fracture can be quite painful.
                    Difficulty with getting up/down from bed, a chair and even difficulty walking are experienced.</p>

                <h5>What are Degenerative Diseases?</h5>
                <p>Degenerative diseases of the spine fall under the categories of Degenerative Disc Disease (DDD) or
                    Degenerative Joint Disease (DJD). In the spine, this is typically due to age and genetics. The
                    wearing down of the joints or discs causes loss in normal height of the bony segments in the back.
                    This can cause excessive joint pressures, bone on bone rubbing and increased inflammation. Typically
                    with DDD or DJD comes stiffening of the spinal joints and weakening of key spinal muscles.</p>

                <h5>What is Spondylolisthesis?</h5>
                <p>
                    Spondylolisthesis is a condition by where one spinal bone (vertebrae) is not in alignment with the
                    other. Typically, a slippage forward is found in the very low back at the 4th or 5th lumbar (low
                    back) vertebrae. This is due to a stretching out of the ligaments that hold the bones together or
                    possibly a fracture. With poor posture and weakened abdominals as well as spinal muscles, the
                    increase in the angle of the spine becomes too much over time and misalignment of the bones occurs.
                    <br>

                    Symptoms can be mild such as general fatigue to the low back, achy pain or severe symptoms if there
                    is compression on the nerves exciting the spine or spinal cord. There are varying degrees of
                    severity. Most fall into a mild to moderate category that can be stabilized with improved posture
                    and muscle strengthening. In severe cases, surgery may be necessary to fuse the area and bring
                    stability back.

                <h5>
                    How physical therapy helps
                </h5>
                <p>
                    Physical therapy helps to bring stability and support to the low back pain allowing the muscles to
                    create more support for the overstretched ligaments. We work with you and your physician to create a
                    program that improves mobility in other spinal areas that may be inflexible, strengthen key muscles
                    to stabilize the spine and educate you on the proper techniques to maintain spinal stability. <br>

                    Other areas may need to be addressed such as hip weakness, poor balance or radiating symptoms to the
                    legs. Physical therapy can help treat the root source of these symptoms and get you back to feeling
                    great quickly. In the event that surgery is required we will be with you every step of the way to
                    ensure a thorough recovery.

                <h5>What is Osteoporosis ?</h5>
                <p>
                    Osteoporosis is a very common condition in women after the age of 40, but men do suffer from this
                    condition too. Osteoporosis is a thinning of the bones due to the change in calcium depositing and
                    uptake. As we age, this cycle tends to take out more calcium than is put into our bones. Common
                    areas for osteoporosis are in the spine and hips. <br>

                    Osteoporosis makes people more susceptible to fractures from ordinary activities. Often, compression
                    fractures in the spine a crumbling of the bone. A lot can be done to address osteoporosis and even
                    improve bone strength. This comes from strengthening exercises, medication, a good walking program
                    and proper nutrition.

                </h5>
                <p>
                    Since strengthening is a critical part of osteoporosis management, physical therapists are experts
                    in preparing a coordinated, easy-to-do exercise program to target specific osteoporotic areas.
                    Often, people with osteoporosis will also have limited spinal and hip movement, which increases the
                    stresses on bones. Physical therapists are experts at treating these limitations and restoring your
                    body to a more optimum state. <br>

                    We work in conjunction with your doctor to program out a specific treatment plan for you ensuring a

                <h5>What is Herniated or Bulging Disc?</h5>
                <p>
                    A disc is a jelly like, fluid filled sac that acts as a cushion between the bones of your neck
                    (vertebrae). Your discs change as you age, drying out and becoming more brittle. In addition, as the
                    discs dry out with age, the change in height between the vertebrae decreases, causing changes in
                    posture and function. In younger adults, the center of the disc (nucleus) is held in place by many
                    rings of the disc (picture a cross section of a tree trunk). With minor or major injuries, poor
                    posture and strain, these rings can rupture allowing a pressing outward of the disc nucleus.
                    Finally, as the nucleus reaches the outer edges, the disc can begin to bulge, which in turn can rub
                    and irritate nerve roots exiting your spine. <br>

                    In more severe cases, the disc can become herniated, which further presses into the spaces where
                    nerves are exiting. Symptoms can range from localized pain, to numbness / tingling to a specific
                    part of the shoulder, arm or hands. In more severe cases complete lack of sensation, muscle weakness
                    and paralysis of an area of the upper extremity can occur. <br>

                    Changes in posture, strength and range of motion can all affect the positioning of the disc and how
                    much bulging or herniation is occurring.

                <p>
                    The good news is that the majority of bulging and herniated discs can be treated conservatively with
                    physical therapy. By working with your medical history, symptoms and testing, our physical
                    therapists can determine what areas have been affected. <br>

                    A thorough plan is then created to relieve pressure on the disc by improving joint function, muscle
                    strength and posture. Modalities, such as ultrasound or electrical stimulation may be used to reduce
                    pain, muscle spasm or inflammation. Our therapists work with you to recover lost strength and range
                    of motion. In addition, we then train you on the correct exercises to maintain good posture and
                    reduce the risk of future episodes. Call us today to discover how we can help relieve your pain

                <h5>What is Spinal Arthritis?</h5>
                <p>
                    Spinal Arthritis is a very common area for osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. The low back
                    takes a tremendous strain throughout our lifetime, supporting the body, moving, sitting and
                    repetitively bending. In addition to these contributing factors, arthritis can also be affected by
                    genetics, age, previous injuries, diet and exercise. <br>

                    With abnormal forces on the back, the cartilage on the joints at each level of the spine can rub
                    down causing even wear, build up of bone and eventually bone on bone rubbing. This can result in
                    painful movement of the spinal joints and chronic, achy pain in the low back. Much like an arthritic
                    knee, the spinal joints are helped through restoring natural movement, improving support from the
                    spinal muscles and proper posture.</p>

                <h5>What is Spinal Stenosis?</h5>
                <p>
                    Spinal Stenosis is a condition that typically goes hand in hand with spinal arthritis. Spinal
                    stenosis refers to a narrowing of the central spinal canal or the canals where the nerves exit the
                    spine to the lower legs (called foramen). These canals are made up of overlapping spinal bones
                    (vertebrae) over another. With degeneration of the spinal joints, collapsing of the disc height or
                    abnormal bone growth, the canals can narrow. This leads to rubbing and even pressure on the nerves,
                    which can cause a multitude of symptoms.</p>

                <h5>
                    How physical therapy helps
                </h5>
                <p>
                    Physical therapy can have a very positive effect on patients with spinal arthritis and spinal
                    stenosis. While our therapists cannot revert your arthritis degeneration, we can restore more
                    natural movement to the spinal joints, improve flexibility to increase joint fluid circulation,
                    improve spinal muscle strength and educate you on correct posture and prevention techniques. <br>

                    The result is that you can do more, with less pain. Often, patients report significant reduction in
                    pain and improvement in daily activities from just a few short weeks of physical therapy. Call us
                    today to find out more how we can help you have pain relief from spinal stenosis!

                <h5>What is Sciatica?</h5>
                <p>
                    Sciatica is the term used to describe radiating pain into the buttock that can travel down the back
                    of the thigh. Often this pain is achy and spread out along these areas. Sciatica is a result of
                    irritation to the sciatic nerve, which travels deep in the buttock and down the back of the leg. In
                    about 20% of people, the sciatic nerve pierces through the piriformis muscle deep in the buttock
                    instead of under it. This can make the sciatic nerve more susceptible to irritation and pressure
                    from the piriformis muscle. The piriformis muscle helps guide hip movement, but can become very
                    tight with prolonged sitting. This increased tightness causes pressure and irritation to the sciatic
                    nerve causing pain.</p>

                <h5>What is Radiating Pain?</h5>
                <p>


                    Radiating pain to the leg doesn’t necessarily mean you have sciatica, but it does tell you that
                    something is wrong. Irritated muscles and tissue often can radiate pain. Spread-out, achy pain is
                    often indicative of this type of problem. Sharp, stabbing pain with numbness or tingling is more
                    nerve irritation or compression occurring in the low back or leg. These types of sensations
                    typically occur to specific parts of the leg.</p>

                    Physical therapy is one of the best treatments for Sciatica and radiating pain into the leg. It
                    first takes a thorough evaluation to determine where your problem is starting. Our physical
                    therapists take time to examine the movement of your spine, hips and legs. Range of motion,

                <h5>About Mid back pain</h5>
                <p>

                    Mid back pain refers to pain in the “thoracic” spine. This is the area from the shoulders down to
                    the mid back area. Pain in this area can be for a variety of reasons, but typically occurs from poor
                    posture or a forward slouched posture. With this posture, your back muscles stretch out, causing
                    weakness. <br>

                    Pain can often feel like a burning or sometimes shooting pain to the mid back area. At times, pain
                    can even feel like it is radiating under the shoulder blade. However, with most mid back pain, it
                    can be difficult to really pinpoint the area it is hurting.

                <p>
                    Physical therapy is very important in treating mid back pain. Our physical therapists work with you
                    to discover spinal areas that may not be moving ideally. This limitation in movement can cause
                    strain on the sections above and below that affected area. By improving spinal joint mobility,
                    soothing sore muscles and restoring posture, your mid back pain can be relieved quite quickly. <br>

                <h5>About Low Back Pain</h5>
                <p>
                    Low back pain is one of the most common conditions seen by physicians across the country. It is said
                    that over 80% of people will suffer some sort of low back pain during their lifetime. Low back pain
                    can occur for a variety of reasons, but typically all have one or more of the following factors:
                </p>
                <li>Poor motion and mobility</li>
                <li>Spinal, abdominal or hip weakness</li>
                <li>Poor coordination of the spinal, abdominal and pelvic muscles</li>
                <p>
                    While there are many items to mask low back pain, such as medication, it is important to address the
                    true causes of low back pain. Most low back pain is caused by the 3 factors above. When your spinal
                    joints and muscles don’t move properly, tremendous strain occurs in your low back. This causes
                    irritation and inflammation, which build up over time. Typically, low back pain suffers will have
                    more pain after sitting or lying down for prolonged periods, such as getting up from a chair or
                    first thing in the morning after sleeping. With severe pain, reaching or bending down for objects
                    can be limited. <br>

                    If pain is felt more with prolonged standing or walking, this can be a result of significant hip or
                    spinal weakness, again causing strain to the low back. With weakness in the spinal, abdominal or hip
                    muscles, the amount of force transferred to the back with everyday activities increases. With
                    bending down, the knees are often not used properly, and the muscles of the spine have to do extra
                    work. This sets up the person for injury with lifting or even something as simple as bending down to
                    tie one’s shoes.

                <h5>About Back Sprain / Strain</h5>
                <p>
                    It can be quite easy to sprain or strain your back. A sprain refers to an overstretching injury of
                    your ligaments in your spine, whereas a strain refers to an overstretching injury to your muscles.
                    There are hundreds of small muscles in the spine, which guide the intricate movements of each bone
                    and multi-level joints. This delicate ballet of movement can get into trouble when heavy lifting is
                    involved. <br>

                    The majority of people sprain or strain their back when they combine lifting with twisting. The best
                    way to avoid an injury to the low back is to use your legs when lifting, bending at the knees and
                    keeping your back fairly straight. If you have to turn while lifting, move your feet, otherwise the
                    strain of lifting while twisting can cause injury. <br>

                    Tearing of the tissues occurs during a sprain / strain. While this is often not a full complete
                    tear, the resulting damage can cause significant swelling and pain to occur deep in the back.
                    Typical healing times can take at least 6-12 weeks for complete healing.
                </p>

                </h5>
                <p>
                    Physical therapy is very important in your recovery from a back sprain / strain. The sooner we can
                    see you, the better. After the injury, it is important for you to receive therapy to reduce the
                    inflammation process as quickly as possible. Often, the root cause of the problem is limited motion
                    in the hips or pelvis and even mid-back which causes abnormal forces in the low back.

                    Our therapists work with you to loosen any restricted areas, improve movement, quickly reduce your
                    pain and strengthen your core muscles to prevent injury. It is vital that you complete a full course
                    of therapy to ensure that you don’t reinjure your back again. Studies have shown that people who do
                    not properly retrain their core muscles after a sprain / strain injury are more likely to re-injure
                    their back again. Call us today to discover how we can help you quickly relieve your back pain and
                    get back to the activities you enjoy.
