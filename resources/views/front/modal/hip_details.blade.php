                <h5>Hip Sprain / Strain</h5>
                <p>
                    Sprains refer to injuries of the ligaments (connect bone to bone) and strains refer to injuries of
                    the muscles or tendons (connect muscle to bone). Sprains and strains occur from quick
                    over-stretching of the tissues causing micro-tearing and subsequent injury. Swelling begins as part
                    of the inflammation process, causing pain and difficulty with movement. <br>

                    The first step in treating sprains or strains in the hip is to rest, ice and elevate it. With severe
                    limitations in movement you should see your physical therapist right away. There are different
                    levels of sprain or strain from mild to severe. In some cases, the tearing can be complete and even
                    be in need of surgical repair.</p>

                <p>
                    In most cases, physical therapy can effectively help you recover from a sprain or strain. We first
                    evaluate the injured area to determine the extent of the injury and ensure that the ligaments or
                    tendons are still intact. After we pinpoint the injured area, we formulate a treatment plan that
                    will quickly relieve your swelling, pain and begin restoring range of motion. <br>

                    The goal of physical therapy is to restore your normal range of motion and restore normal strength.
                    If you participate in sports or are very active, we work closely with you to make sure you fully
                    recover and can participate in those activities you love to do. Call us today to discover how we can
                    effectively treat your sprains or strains.

                <h5>What is Trochanteric Bursitis?</h5>
                <p>The ending of the word “itis” is defined as inflammation. Therefore, bursitis is inflammation of a
                    bursa and tendonitis is inflammation of a tendon. A bursa is a fluid filled sac that sits between
                    muscles or tissues to cushion and reduce friction. In the hip there is a rather large bursa on the
                    outside between the bony area (tronchanter) and the thick band of tissue stretching from your hip to
                    your knee (iliotibial band). This is called the tronchanteric bursa. <br>
                    This bursa can often become inflamed due to abnormal joint movements, poor posture and weakness of
                    the surrounding musculature. This causes strain to the tissues and excessive friction on the bursa.
                    People tend to feel pain with prolonged walking or standing. It is often, very tender to touch on
                    the outer hip and thigh.

                    How physical therapy helps

                <p>
                    Physical therapy is the first line in conservative treatment for trochanteric bursitis. Since most
                    bursitis is due to underlying abnormal movement and weakness, our trained physical therapists
                    evaluate your movement to pinpoint the source of the trouble. Modalities may be used to alleviate
                    pain and discomfort, while hands-on therapy improves joint mechanics and range of motion. <br>

                    Finally, gentle strengthening exercises and joint coordination exercises help to restore stability
                    to the affected area and prevent re-occurrence of the symptoms. To find out more on how we can help

                <h5>About Osteoarthritis of the hip</h5>
                <p>Osteoarthritis of the hip can be painful as the hip is needed to move with sit to stand, walking,
                    squatting and bending. The hips take a lot of wear and tear over the years leading to a degeneration
                    of the cartilage that lines the joint. As the cartilage wears over time, the joint becomes stiffer
                    and the muscles of the buttocks generally weaken over time. This compounds the effects on the hip
                    causing grinding and wearing. In advanced stages, bony spurs can form around the joint and even
                    change the shape of the joint. <br>

                    Most minor to moderate cases of hip osteoarthritis can highly benefit from physical therapy. In
                    advanced stages a total or partial hip replacement may be needed to repair the damaged joint.
                    Physical therapy in the hospital and outpatient facilities is highly important in the recovery from
                    a hip replacement surgery.

                <p>
                    The pain associated with osteoarthritis of the hip comes from inflammation in and around the joint
                    from wear and tear. Tight muscles, tendons, ligaments and tissues occur with osteoarthritis further
                    limiting joint movement. In addition, weakness of the buttock muscles and hip rotators generally
                    occurs because of the loss of movement. <br>

                    Physical therapy can improve joint mobility, range of motion and muscle strength. Our hands-on
                    therapy and specialized exercises normally achieve a marked improvement in your hip range of motion.
                    First we thoroughly evaluate the mechanics of your hip joint, walking and hip muscle coordination.
                    By pinpointing the specific areas that need attention, we formulate a plan to quickly relieve your
                    pain, improve your motion and walking. Call us today to find out more how we can help your

                <h5>What is Sciatica?</h5>
                <p>Sciatica is a term used to describe radiating pain into the buttock that may travel down the back of
                    the thigh. Often this pain is achy and spread out along the buttock and back of the thigh. <br>

                    Sciatica typically comes from irritation to the sciatic nerve, which travels deep in the buttock and
                    down the back of the leg. In about 20% of people, the sciatic nerve pierces through the piriformis
                    muscle deep in the buttock, instead of underneath it. This muscle helps guide hip movement, but can
                    become very tight with prolonged sitting. This tightens causes pressure and irritation to the
                    sciatic nerve causing pain. <br>

                    Radiating pain to the leg doesn’t necessarily mean you have sciatica, but it does tell you that
                    something is wrong. Irritated muscles and tissue often can radiate pain. Spread-out, achy pain is
                    often indicative of this type of problem. Sharp, stabbing pain with numbness or tingling is more
                    nerve irritation or compression occurring in the back or leg. This typically occurs more to specific
                    parts of the leg.

                <h5>About Hip Pain and Thigh Pain</h5>
                <p>
                    Hip pain is typically felt in 3 places, the groin, outer hip or deep buttock. Depending on where the
                    pain is focused corresponds to the dysfunction around that area. The hip joint is incredible as it
                    moves through a large range of motion, while bearing the weight of the body and providing stability.
                    <br>

                    Most hip pain stems from limited motion of the hip causing abnormal pressures to different muscles,
                    tendons or ligaments around the area. With acute pain, it can be felt deep in the groin or outer
                    hip. However, with more severe irritation, radiating pain can even be felt into the thigh or knee.
                    <br>

                    Having flexible hip joints with strong muscular support is key to a healthy back. When the hips
                    don’t move like they should, the normal forces of walking, bending and squatting are transferred to
                    the spine instead of the hips.

                    The piriformis muscle is deep in the buttocks and helps with rotating the hip. The sciatic nerve
                    typically dives underneath the piriformis muscle as it makes it way down to the leg. With excessive
                    sitting, loss of movement in the hips or trauma, the piriformis muscle can press down onto the
                    sciatic nerve. Typically, mild symptoms cause aching deep into the buttock and often radiating pain
                    to the outer thigh. With more severe cases, tingling, numbness or severe pain can radiate down the

                <p>
                    It takes us at least 12 months as a baby to learn the fundamentals of walking. It takes even longer
                    to learn how to walk properly and eventually run. Walking is very complex and requires good balance,
                    the ability to know where your joints are in space (proprioception), the ability to know how your
                    joints are moving (kinesthesia), good range of motion and strength. <br>

                    As we age, with declining activity, or after an injury, walking can become difficult. With previous
                    injuries or pain in the knee or hip, our walking pattern can change leaving us with a limp or even
                    worse, back pain. Changes in posture can also be responsible for changes in walking patterns. <br>

                    When walking patterns change, abnormal stresses and strains with everyday activities can be
                    transmitted to areas it shouldn’t. For example, if you have knee pain and you begin to limp, the
                    other hip and your spine now have to take double the weight. This can lead to pain and dysfunction
                    in those areas also. The good news is that if you have difficulty walking, you can be helped.
                    Physical therapists are the experts uniquely trained to do so.

                <p>
                    Other types of surgeries for the hip are fracture repairs using pinning or repair from trauma. The
                    amount of force it takes to break bone means that the soft tissues around the hip are most likely
                    significantly injured also. After surgery, due to limited movement, range of motion is lost as well
                    as strength, rather quickly. Since walking is a very complex action of different muscles moving in a
                    coordinated action, it can be difficult to walk after a hip surgery.
