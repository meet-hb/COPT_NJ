                <h5>What is Achilles Tendonitis?</h5>
                <p>
                    Achilles tendonitis is an inflammation of the Achilles tendon that attaches your calf muscle to the
                    back of your heel. Achilles tendonitis is typically caused by tightness in the hamstrings and calf
                    muscles. In addition, limitations in ankle and foot range of motion can alter your walking pattern,
                    putting excessive strain on the Achilles tendon, causing tendonitis. <br>

                    Typically, the back of the ankle and heel is very painful to touch, especially after prolonged
                    walking. Rest tends to help Achilles tendonitis while walking aggravates it.

                <h5>What is Plantar Fasciitis?</h5>
                <p>Plantar fasciitis refers to inflammation of the plantar fascia, which is a thick band of tissue on
                    the underside of the foot, connecting from the heel to the ball of the foot. Plantar fasciitis
                    typically occurs from tightening of the tissues under the foot and even further up in the legs. In
                    addition, changes in the shape of the foot, such as fallen arches or changes in shoe wear can affect
                    plantar fasciitis. Furthermore, with changes in walking posture for a variety of reasons, the strain
                    on the plantar fascia can increase significantly. <br>

                    Plantar fasciitis is commonly felt as burning or sharp pain when standing on the affected leg. This
                    typically occurs first thing in the morning or with initial standing after sitting for a prolonged
                    period. Inflammation builds up during the day in the fascia, and may begin to hurt after prolonged
                    walking. As you sit or sleep the inflammation thickens and the plantar fascia stiffens. When you go
                    to step on the foot, the inflamed and stiff tissue stretches causing pain. Pain may be felt mostly
                    in the heel, but can extend along the bottom of the foot.

                <h5>About Ankle instability</h5>
                <p>Ankle instability typically occurs after the ligaments in the ankle have stretched out, losing the
                    normal stability of the bones in the ankle and foot. This can be a result of an injury or occur over
                    a long period of time from poor foot positioning, bad shoe wear or genetic predisposition. <br>

                    When there is ankle instability the probability of further ankle sprains increases significantly.
                    While the ligaments themselves may not be able to shorten back to normal, the muscles supporting the
                    ankle can be strengthened to take up the slack. This compensation allows for better stability in the
                    ankle and foot with walking, running and sports. Bracing may also be needed depending on the
                    severity of the instability.

                <h5>Foot and Ankle Post-surgery Rehab</h5>
                <p>There are many different surgeries for the foot and ankle from fracture repairs to tissue repair from
                    trauma. In addition, common surgeries such as bunionectomies, hammer toe, and even ankle fusions
                    will require physical therapy. <br>

                    After surgery, due to limited post-operative movement and inflammation from the surgery, your range
                    of motion and strength will be diminished. The loss of strength and range of motion in the foot or
                    ankle can cause many problems in daily life including difficulty standing for short periods of time
                    and an inability to easily use a set of stairs. When you are unable to stand for periods of time or
                    walk on your own it can result in lost work hours and financial loss. But with a skilled physical
                    therapist working with you, you can get great results and return to previous activities without pain
                    or loss of function.

                <h5>Ankle Sprain / Strain</h5>
                <p>
                    Ankle sprains are very common injuries and typically occur from improper footwear on uneven terrain.
                    Most often, sprains occur from sports or trips over objects that were unseen. Sprains refer to
                    injuries of the ligaments (connect bone to bone) and strains refer to injuries of the muscles or
                    tendons (connect muscle to bone). Sprains and strains occur from quick over-stretching of the
                    tissues causing micro-tearing and subsequent injury. Swelling begins as part of the inflammation
                    process, causing pain and difficulty with movement. <br>
                    The first step in treating sprains or strains in the ankle is to rest, ice and elevate it. Common
                    sprains in the ankle occur on the outside of the ankle where 3 main ligaments attach. There are
                    different levels of sprain or strain from mild to severe. With severe limitations in movement you
                    should see your physical therapist right away. In some cases, the tearing can be complete and even
                    be in need of surgical repair.

                <p>
                    In most cases, physical therapy can effectively help you recover from a sprain or strain. We first
                    evaluate the injured area to determine the extent of the injury and ensure that the ligaments or
                    tendons are still intact. We then formulate a treatment plan that will quickly relieve your
                    swelling, pain and begin restoring range of motion. <br>

                    The goal of physical therapy is to restore your normal range of motion and eventually restore normal
                    strength. If you participate in sports or are very active, we will work closely with you to make
                    sure that you fully recover and can participate in those activities you love to do. Call us today to

                <p>
                    There are many bones that can be fractured in the ankle and foot. Typical fractures that occur are
                    to the fibula bone (avulsion fracture), metatarsal bone fractures and calcaneal fractures. Fractures
                    are typically immobilized with casting or bracing. In severe cases surgery may be required to align
                    and stabilize the bone with pins or plates. <br>

                    After being immobile for a period of time whether from casting or surgery, the ankle and foot joints
                    will become quite stiff. This loss of motion in the joint also causes discomfort and results in lost
                    muscle strength in the ankle and foot.

                <h5>Difficulty walking</h5>
                <p>
                    It takes us at least 12 months as a baby to learn the fundamentals of walking. It takes even longer
                    to learn how to walk properly and eventually run. Walking is very complex and requires good balance,
                    the ability to know where your joints are in space (proprioception), the ability to know how your
                    joints are moving (kinesthesia), good range of motion and strength. <br>

                    As we age, with declining activity, or after an injury, walking can become difficult. With previous
                    injuries or pain in the knee or hip, our walking pattern can change leaving us with a limp or even
                    worse, back pain. Changes in posture can also be responsible for changes in walking patterns. <br>

                    When walking patterns change, abnormal stresses and strains with everyday activities can be
                    transmitted to areas it shouldn’t. For example, if you have knee pain and you begin to limp, the
                    other hip and your spine now have to take double the weight. This can lead to pain and dysfunction
                    in those areas also. The good news is that if you have difficulty walking, you can be helped.
                    Physical therapists are the experts uniquely trained to do so.

                    One of the main specialties of physical therapy is helping people to walk normally. This takes a
                    thorough evaluation of your range of motion, strength, walking patterns, balance and coordination.
                    By discovering in what area you have difficulties we can paint a picture of why your walking is not
                    as it should be. <br>

                    We then coordinate a treatment plan that will address your range of motion, pain, coordination,
                    balance and strength. The end result is the ability to walk without the need of an assistive device

                <p>
                    Other types of surgeries for the hip are fracture repairs using pinning or repair from trauma. The
                    amount of force it takes to break bone means that the soft tissues around the hip are most likely
                    significantly injured also. After surgery, due to limited movement, range of motion is lost as well
                    as strength, rather quickly. Since walking is a very complex action of different muscles moving in a
                    coordinated action, it can be difficult to walk after a hip surgery.
